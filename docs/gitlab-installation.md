# How to Setup gitStream with GitLab

!!! info "Prerequisites"

    1. GitLab cloud
    2. GitLab runner v15 or higher
    3. <a href="https://app.linearb.io/login" target="_blank">Login</a>, or <a href="https://app.linearb.io/sign-up" target="_blank">create a free account</a> on the LinearB app, and follow the steps to <a href="https://linearb.helpdocs.io/article/0xxpvue4s9-connect-git-stream-using-a-git-lab-integration" target="_blank">connect gitStream Using a GitLab Integration</a>.

GitLab Installation Overview

1. Designate a gitStream user account.
1. Create a CM configuration file.
1. Create a GitLab pipeline.
1. Install the gitStream service.

## Designate a gitStream User Account

gitStream automation rules are executed on behalf of the user account configured when you install the gitStream service. This account must have the `maintainer` or `owner` role to the relevant repos.

We recommend creating a [dedicated service account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/service_accounts.html){:target="_blank"} to control access to individual repos easily. You can also use your professional or personal GitLab account for this, which would result in all automations being executed under that account, which might also affect LinearB's metrics.

!!! tip "Use this account when you integrate gitStream"
    Make sure to use this account when authorizing GitLab in LinearB.

## Create a `cm` repo and a CM Configuration File

Group rules are ideal when you want to enforce consistent rules across every repo in your GitLab group. You can define them by creating a special repository named `cm` in the parent group for the git repositories on which you want to run gitStream. Here, you can add automation files that apply to **all** repositories within that group that are connected to gitStream.

Create a `cm` project (repository) in your GitLab group, and create a `gitstream.cm` rules file in the root directory of your `cm` repository's default branch (usually `master` or `main`). This file will contain a YAML configuration that determines the workflows that run on your organization's repos. You can name the CM file anything you want as long as it ends in `.cm`

!!! info "Configuration files go in the repo's root directory."
	Group-level rules require your `.cm` files to be placed in the repository's root directory.
	You can also define specific repo-level rules under the `.cm` folder in each of the connected repositories

!!! example "Example Configuration"
		Here is an example of a gitStream configuration file to set up some basic workflow automations.
		```yaml+jinja
		--8<-- "docs/downloads/gitlab/gitstream.cm"
		```

## Create a GitLab Pipeline

Once your gitStream configuration file is set up, you need a GitLab CI configuration file to trigger gitStream automations. Create a `cm` project (repository) in your GitLab group if you haven't already. It should be created in the same group or a parent group of the target repositories. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your new `cm` repository's default branch (usually `master` or `main`) and add the following configuration:

=== "GitLab-Hosted runners"

    **Gitlab-Hosted Runners**

    Use the following `.gitlab-ci.yml`

	``` yaml+jinja
    --8<-- "docs/downloads/gitlab-ci.yml"
    ```

=== "Self-Managed Runners - Shell"
    **Self-Managed Runners**

	First, [register the runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/){:target="_blank"} with a tag, and use the named tag in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

	### Shell executors

	Use the tag created above in the workflow file `cm/.gitlab-ci.yml` instead `REGISTERED-TAG`
    ``` yaml+jinja
    --8<-- "docs/downloads/gitlab-shell-ci.yml"
    ```

=== "Self-Managed Runners - Kubernetes"
    **Self-Managed Runners**

	First, [register the runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/){:target="_blank"} with a tag, and use the named tag in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

	### Kubernetes executors
	1. Ensure your runner configuration (`config.toml` for example) has the followig:
	``` yaml
	[runners.kubernetes]
    privileged = true
	```
	2. Use the tag created above in the workflow file `cm/.gitlab-ci.yml` instead `REGISTERED-TAG`
    ``` yaml+jinja
    --8<-- "docs/downloads/gitlab-k8s-ci.yml"
    ```

!!! tip "**Configuring the image location**"
	By default, gitStream pulls the image from DockerHub each time it is invoked. You can configure gitStream to pull the docker image from your own registry, to allow faster build times and reduced bandwidth usage - especially for teams with high CI/CD throughput, by downloading the image and storing it in your own registry (ECR or K8S registry, for example) and changing the `cm/.gitlab-ci.yml` accordingly:
	```
	script:
    - ...
    - docker pull YOUR-REGISTRY-URL/gitstream/rules-engine:latest
	```
	The docker image can be pulled to your private repository from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitstream/rules-engine){:target=_blank}.
## Next Step
If you successfully complete these instructions, gitStream will now do these two things.

When a PR is created or changed, apply or update a label that provides an estimated time to review.
![Estimated Review Time label](automations/provide-estimated-time-to-review/provide_estimated_time_to_review.png)

When a `suggest-reviewers` label is applied to a PR, gitStream will comment with a list of code experts.
